# Seung Seok Lee's Portfolio
"Hardware Mindset, Data Science Vision"

</br>

## :pushpin: Intro
I am a Master of Science in Data Science student at the University of Michigan, currently working as a Research Assistant on machine learning and statistical modeling projects. My academic journey began in South Korea, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from Inha University. This interdisciplinary foundation allows me to bridge the gap between hardware systems and data-driven insights, leveraging both engineering intuition and analytical rigor.

### 1. [H1B Visa Analysis](https://github.com/norobotp/Relationships-between-H1B-Visa-Living-Wage-and-Income)
>Analysis of H1B Visa Distribution and Economic Indicators using Machine Learning (Team Project)
>  
>Duration: 2024 Winter Academic Year 
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn
>
>  Summary:
> Conducted EDA and statistical modeling to analyze the relationship between H1B visa approvals, prevailing wages, and cost of living. Implemented classification and regression models to identify key predictors across job sectors and geographies. Revealed wage disparities and approval trends, offering insights for immigration and labor policy analysis.

### 2. [Job Matching IR Engine](https://github.com/norobotp/Job-Matching-IR-Engine)
>Location-Aware Semantic Search System (Team Leader)
> 
>Duration: 2024 Fall Academic Year
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / BM25 / BERT / LightGBM / Cross-Encoder / TF-IDF
>
>  Summary:
>  Built a location-aware job search engine that interprets natural language queries and ranks job results by relevance. Designed and deployed a hybrid ranker combining BM25 and a BERT-based cross-encoder with location filtering. Enhanced user experience through an interactive front-end and improved retrieval performance over traditional keyword search.

### 3. [Bayesian Analysis of H1B Visa Approval Patterns](https://github.com/norobotp/Bayesian-Analysis-of-H1B-Visa-Approval-Patterns)
>Statistical Analysis of H1B Visa Approval Patterns using Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (Team Leader)
> 
>Duration: 2024 Fall Academic Year
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / Stan / R / Bayesian Modeling / Data Analysis / Statistical Inference
>
>  Summary:
>  Developed a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression model using USCIS H1B data from 2022–2024. Modeled interactions between employer size, industry, and location to identify probabilistic factors behind visa approval rates. Produced interpretable visualizations and optimized priors using Stan MCMC diagnostics.

### 4. [Cancer Survival Prediction](https://github.com/norobotp/Cancer-Patient-Survival-Time-Prediction)
>Predicting Cancer Patient Survival Time using Spatial Proteomics Data (Team Leader)
> 
>Duration: 2024 Winter Academic Year
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / CNN / Random Forest / ResNet / DenseNet / Deep Learning
>
>  Summary:
>  Predicted cancer patients’ survival time using spatial proteomics data from 52 protein channels. Extracted statistical and morphological features and trained DNN and ensemble models. The best-performing model, CNN-RFR (denoise), achieved superior MAE and R² scores. Applied denoising to reduce noisy channels and improve prediction accuracy in a high-dimensional biomedical context.
