# Seung Seok Lee's Portfolio
"Hardware Mindset, Data Science Vision"

</br>

## :pushpin: Intro
I am a Data Scientist at the University of Michigan, where I am also pursuing my Master of Science in Data Science. My academic journey began in South Korea, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from Inha University. This unique combination of electronics engineering and data science allows me to bring a distinctive perspective to data-driven problem solving.

My background in electronics, coupled with my current role as a Data Scientist, enables me to bridge the gap between hardware systems and data analytics. At the University of Michigan, I apply this interdisciplinary knowledge to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets while maintaining a deep understanding of the underlying systems.

## :pushpin: Projects
### 1. [H1B Visa Analysis](https://github.com/norobotp/Relationships-between-H1B-Visa-Living-Wage-and-Income)
>Analysis of H1B Visa Distribution and Economic Indicators using Machine Learning (Team Project)
>  
>Duration: 2024 Winter Academic Year 
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn
>
>  Summary:
>  This project analyzed the relationship between H1B visa approvals, wage levels, and economic factors using exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. We examined the correlation between prevailing wage, cost of living, and H1B approval rates across different job sectors and geographic locations. Using regression models and classification algorithms, we identified key predictors influencing visa approvals and uncovered disparities in wage levels among different industriesâ€‹.

### 2. [Job Matching IR Engine](https://github.com/norobotp/Job-Matching-IR-Engine)
>Location-Aware Semantic Search System (Team Leader)
> 
>Duration: 2024 Fall Academic Year
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / BM25 / BERT / LightGBM / Cross-Encoder / TF-IDF
>
>  Summary:
>  This project focused on developing a location-aware job search engine that leverages semantic matching and ranking models to improve job recommendations. Using a combination of BM25, BERT-based Cross-Encoders, and Learning-to-Rank (L2R) techniques, we optimized search results based on job descriptions, required skills, and geographic constraints. The final model outperformed traditional keyword-based retrieval methods, providing more contextually relevant job recommendations.

### 3. [Bayesian Analysis of H1B Visa Approval Patterns](https://github.com/norobotp/Bayesian-Analysis-of-H1B-Visa-Approval-Patterns)
>Statistical Analysis of H1B Visa Approval Patterns using Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (Team Leader)
> 
>Duration: 2024 Fall Academic Year
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / Stan / R / Bayesian Modeling / Data Analysis / Statistical Inference
>
>  Summary:
>  This study applied hierarchical Bayesian modeling to analyze H1B visa approval patterns, leveraging USCIS employer petition data from 2022-2024. We identified key factors influencing visa approval rates, including employer application volume, industry sector, and geographic distribution. Using Bayesian inference, we derived probabilistic insights for optimizing application strategies and quantified disparities in approval rates across different sectors and regions.

### 4. [Cancer Survival Prediction](https://github.com/norobotp/Cancer-Patient-Survival-Time-Prediction)
>Predicting Cancer Patient Survival Time using Spatial Proteomics Data (Team Leader)
> 
>Duration: 2024 Winter Academic Year
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / CNN / Random Forest / ResNet / DenseNet / Deep Learning
>
>  Summary:
>  This project aimed to predict cancer patient survival time using high-dimensional spatial proteomics data. We extracted features from 52 protein channels in tumor images and trained models using CNN, Random Forest, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-201. The best-performing model, CNN-RFR (denoise), improved prediction accuracy, but challenges remained due to data sparsity and confounding factors. This study highlighted the potential of deep learning in survival analysis and the need for further optimization in biomedical AI applications.

### 5. [Analysis of Average House Prices in Seattle](https://github.com/norobotp/Analysis-of-Average-House-Prices-in-Seattle)
>Time Series Forecasting of Seattle Housing Prices using SARIMA and Regression with SARMA Errors (Team Project)
> 
>Duration: 2025 Winter Academic Year
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / R / SARIMA / ARIMA / SARMA / Time Series Analysis / Forecasting
>
>  Summary:
>  This project analyzes the trends and seasonality of housing prices in Seattle using Zillow Research Data. We explored the periodic behavior of housing prices using decomposition, spectral analysis, and autocorrelation functions. Based on these insights, we built SARIMA and Regression models with SARMA errors, comparing their forecasting performances. The study provides valuable insights into real estate price dynamics, seasonal effects, and the impact of external factors such as mortgage rates and inflation.
