# Seung Seok Lee's Portfolio
"Hardware Mindset, Data Science Vision"

</br>

## :pushpin: Intro
I am a Data Scientist at the University of Michigan, where I am also pursuing my Master of Science in Data Science. My academic journey began in South Korea, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from Inha University. This unique combination of electronics engineering and data science allows me to bring a distinctive perspective to data-driven problem solving.

My background in electronics, coupled with my current role as a Data Scientist, enables me to bridge the gap between hardware systems and data analytics. At the University of Michigan, I apply this interdisciplinary knowledge to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets while maintaining a deep understanding of the underlying systems.

### 5. [Analysis of Average House Prices in Seattle](https://github.com/norobotp/Analysis-of-Average-House-Prices-in-Seattle)
>Time Series Forecasting of Seattle Housing Prices using SARIMA and Regression with SARMA Errors (Team Project)
> 
>Duration: 2025 Winter Academic Year
>  
>  Tech Stack:
>  Python / R / SARIMA / ARIMA / SARMA / Time Series Analysis / Forecasting
>
>  Summary:
This project analyzes the trends and seasonality of housing prices in Seattle using Zillow Research Data. We explored the periodic behavior of housing prices using decomposition, spectral analysis, and autocorrelation functions. Based on these insights, we built SARIMA and Regression models with SARMA errors, comparing their forecasting performances. The study provides valuable insights into real estate price dynamics, seasonal effects, and the impact of external factors such as mortgage rates and inflation.
